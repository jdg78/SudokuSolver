# Sudoku Solver
This is a programming assignment I completed for a data structures class during my sophomore year.

The program may be run by first compiling with
`javac cs445/a3/Sudoku.java`.

You may then run the program using the sample input with
`java cs442.a3.Sudoku easy.su`.

The program will return the solution to the puzzle so long as the input file fits the formatting of `easy.su`.
